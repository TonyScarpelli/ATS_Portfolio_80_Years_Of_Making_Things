Pyrography is the art of burning wood.<br><br>
You take a tool like a soldering iron, heat it up and start the burning process.<br>
But first you have to find wood that burns well with a fine grain, like Basswood.<br>
Then you find a pattern that you want to burn on it.<br>
What I do is look around for a pattern, in books, magazines or on the internet. I tape a piece of carbon paper over the wood, then tape the pattern over that, and with a hard pencil start tracing. When finished remove the pattern and carbon paper and start the burning process.<br>
After a while, depending on the size of the pattern, it's all burned in.<br>
Next, I use water color pencils and fill it in. You can then brush it with water or leave it if it looks all right.<br>
Next I spray two or three coats of polyurethane over it all.<br>
The above dragon was on a box I gave to my sister-in-law for Christmas.<br><br>
